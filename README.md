# QEDSports

Settle arguments about the superior college football team via liberal application of the transitive property.

## What is QEDSports?

College football is rife with heated debates about which team is truly the best. Fans often rely on subjective opinions, biased statistics, or plain supposition to back up their claims. QED (Quasi-Empirical Decisions) Sports was created to provide a clear, objective method for determining team superiority using the transitive property of victories.

## How It Works

### The Transitive Property
QEDSports relies on advanced elementary school math, namely the transitive property. If Team A beats Team B, and Team B beats Team C, then Team A **must be** better than Team C. This process can, of course, be repeated indefinitely without issue. QEDSports finds the smallest chain of victories connecting two teams,
giving you ample evidence to believe that your team can beat anyone.

### The Role of History
The astute reader will likely point out the above approach will fail against undefeated teams. After all, if a team has no losses, there certainly won't be any paths towards them. This is no problem for QEDSports. When no path exists within the current season, the app steps back in time to find games from prior years. Games from past seasons are visually distinguished (faded and muted) so you can quickly see which parts of the chain rely on historical results. This approach, which we call **persistence**, assumes that if Team A defeated Team B in a previous season, that superiority likely persists. Given the [https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-footballs-transfer-portal-has-spun-out-of-control/](current stability) of college rosters, we believe this affirms our conclusions
about persistence.

## Setup

1. **Python 3.11+** recommended. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure data files exist:**
   - `graph.gexf` — the precomputed victory graph (generated by `get_games.ipynb`)
   - `teams.pkl` — team metadata including logos (also from the notebook)

## Running the App Locally

```bash
flask run
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.


## Regenerating the Graph

The `get_games.ipynb` notebook fetches recent seasons from the College Football Data API and generates both `graph.gexf` and `teams.pkl`. To refresh the data when new games are available:

1. Obtain an API key from [collegefootballdata.com](https://collegefootballdata.com)
2. Set your `CFB_API_KEY` as an environment variable (i.e `echo CFB_API_KEY=your-api-key > .env`)
3. Run the notebook
4. The precomputed graph will be updated with the latest results
